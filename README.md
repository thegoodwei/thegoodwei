Passionate about publishing Content as Currency on Web3

The first ICO I helped launch was back in '18, as a film producer/marketer, but it took me until '21 to really understand the potential for content creators on web3, and I've since become obsessed with Solidity development to contribute to the future of the fair-shared internet. I'm now programming erc-1155 Smart Contracts on Ethereum / Matic, and working on a next-gen NFT dapp for a publishing solution providing distributed monetization software for shared ownership of premium content. I'm open to provide consultations to meet and share with other awesome teams in our space, and I've limited freelance time for building functions to other custom NFT projects.
