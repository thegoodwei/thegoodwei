# I'm Here To Build a Maestro of Collective Memory
Building AI-mediated smart contracts for immutable content publishing with salient sparsity.

The Maestro of Collective Human Memory is my manifesto, a declaration that technology should not only advance humanity but also protect its most precious asset: our stories.

As a documentary filmmaker, technologist, and solarpunk enthusiast, I reside at the intersection of human espression and immutable publishing in the age of AI. With a background in Rust and Python, I've dedicated my skills to weaving a platform that can serve as a communal tapestry of human history.

My vision is twofold:
#### To Preserve:
By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a time capsule for the digital age, an immutable record that resists the erosion of time and the bias of controllers.
#### To Empower: 
Through AI, we synthesize the vast tapestry of human narratives into accessible, coherent stories, ensuring that no voice is drowned out by the cacophony of the majority, reducing the cost of editing for traditional content publishing.

This initiative is more than a project; it's a movement towards a future where technology serves as a guardian of our collective heritage, fostering a world that values sustainability, equity, and shared knowledge above all. As such, alignment of the Maestro is essential; we need new benchmarks to determine how well a model understands the subtle lessons in the narratives provided.

## A Coming Paradigm of Meta-Mass Communication

I founded Papercut AI to dismantle the barriers that obstruct creative expression and equitable distribution in the digital storytelling domain. By simplifying video editing and embedding democratic governance within the content lifecycle, we aspire to empower creators with intuitive tools and a transparent ecosystem.

As the proliferation of content has surpassed our ability to consume and comprehend, the art of storytelling faces significant challenges, hindered by technical complexities, centralized control, and cumbersome processes. 

Traditional content creation, particularly in nonfiction documentary production, is marred by inefficiencies, from the high costs and complexities of editing to the disproportionate allocation of profits favoring publishers over creators and tarnishes an academic branch of observational research with endless funding bias. Papercut AI addresses these challenges head-on, ensuring creators are at the forefront of content monetization and narrative control.

PaperCut AI emerges as a beacon of innovation in Meta-Mass Communication, a platform to automate narrative editing and decentralize content storage and governance, thereby democratizing storytelling. 

At its core, this concept of Meta-Mass Communication extends beyond traditional mass communication methods by embedding a layer of AI-mediated synthesis. It implies a shift from individual or siloed narratives to a comprehensive, collective expression. This form of communication processes and distills the diverse inputs of a community—ranging from audio and video to text and digital interactions—into a singular, cohesive narrative. The use of the term "meta" signifies a higher level of abstraction, where the communication process itself becomes a part of the narrative, reflecting on and integrating the multitude of individual stories into a collective whole.

The concept of Meta-Mass Communication introduces a sophisticated paradigm that leverages artificial intelligence to transform the landscape of storytelling and collective expression. 

## PaperCutAI as a Synthesizer of Collective Experiences
Here’s how it unfolds: You open an intuitive platform signup to see a list of collective chatrooms, each a crucible of creativity centered around themes as diverse as the users themselves. Joining a collective is like becoming a co-creator of a living, breathing narrative. Within these digital rooms, your contributions of video and audio will merge with the stories of others, forming a rich, multifaceted narrative fabric. When the collective decides it's time, this fabric undergoes a transformation through AI's algorithm, distilling the essence into a cohesive storyline that still needs human touch. Here comes the democratic soul of Papercut AI; through collaborative editing and voting, every voice is heard, every suggestion valued to revise the generated narrative that best represents your collective vision. This narrative is then immortalized on the blockchain, not just as a story, but as a testament to collaborative creation, safeguarded for eternity and shared with the world. What follows is an airdrop of tokens to the creators in the chatroom, and a collective decision on how this story steps into the world with monetization or licensing of the catalog, with each contributor's stake honored and rewarded. Papercut AI isn’t just a platform; it’s a journey from individual expression to collective creation, culminating in stories that are not only told but lived, by a community bonded through creativity.

## Moral Alignment in Content Distillation: Measuring AI-Faithfulness to Moral-Story Narratives in Automated Content Editing

Paramount to the use of AI algorithms for compressing masses of messages is the ethical alignment of AI. The bedrock of our initiative to revolutionize documentary creation through decentralized platforms depends on an AI to operate with a moral compass reflective of culturally rich and wise narratives.

The success of this technology is dependant on the perception that a model can be trusted as honest not to censor freedom in its content moderation algorithms. To evaluate these moral metrics, we have embarked on an in-depth exploration of AI's moral comprehension by utilizing various models to interpret and prioritize morals in narratives when distilling thematically significant texts, evaluating the thematic bias of sentence-averaging summarization algorithms.

Our latest research meticulously examines AI's ability to distill profound lessons from parables, allegories, koans, fables, and gospels. This research is pivotal in ensuring that AI does not simply summarize content but does so in a manner that aligns with universal values and lessons, thereby resonating deeply with the human spirit.

### New Paper: The Moral-Summary Alignment Thesis

Our recent experimental work in AI-Safety marks a significant milestone in our capacity to compare cultural alignment across different AI models by benchmarking the lessons conveyed in AI-generated summaries of traditional moral-defining literature. We have devised a novel methodology for assessing the moral priorities embedded within AI algorithms, which extends beyond technical summarization, focusing on the extraction of moral lessons integral to these timeless narratives.

Our paper, "The Moral-Summary Alignment Thesis," introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating AI-generated summaries from an ethical perspective. This thesis provides a mechanism for determining the extent to which AI models prioritize moral lessons in their distillation of content. By concentrating on foundational stories, we elucidate a nuanced methodology for aligning AI with the moral and ethical narratives that are esteemed across cultures.

The insights derived from our alignment research have immediate and profound implications for an AI-mediated documentary blockchain publishing platform. Before AI can effectively transform hours of human voices into concise, coherent narratives, it must grasp the underlying moral essence of the content. This understanding is crucial in ensuring that the summaries not only capture the essence of the original content but also adhere to the ethical standards that underpin our community.
